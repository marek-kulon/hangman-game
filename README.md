## Features

* Implementation in Java 8
* Game state is persisted between restarts in [MapDB] database
* Game state is protected from read-modify-write race conditions
* Interaction between browser and server takes place using Ajax requests

## Requirements

 * JDK8
 * JAVA_HOME variable pointing to active java directory

## Running the App

* If gradle is installed execute following command:

  `$ gradle bootRun`


* If gradle is not installed, on Linux OS, execute following command:

  `$ ./gradlew bootRun`


* If gradle is not installed, on Windows OS, execute following command:

  `gradlew.bat bootRun`

Then point your browser at [http://localhost:8080]

* New Game - Animals
* New Game - Fruits
* New Game - Vegetables

#### Continuing started game
1. Paste game token into input box
2. Click "Load Game" button

## Whatâ€™s Happening Under Hood

#### Server-side

The main class, performing all user actions, is hangman.core.Game. Game contains reference to immutable hangman.core.state.GameState which is a minimum data set required by outer layers of the system to fully visualize game and allow for interaction with the user. Every user action successfully performed on Game changes its current game state.

Game state consist of secret word, allowed number of incorrect guesses and guesses made by user. This information is persisted in database as one object. Described architecture allows for great horizontal scalability.

Most outer layer of back-end is a restful-ish hangman.web.GameController. For communication between Game, GameController and system repositories (game repository and secret repository) responsible is hangman.core.GameService, more precisely hangman.core.GameServiceThreadSafeImpl, which additionally protects code from race conditions that may occasionally occur.

#### Front-end

For interaction between user and back-end responsible is hangman.js library.
